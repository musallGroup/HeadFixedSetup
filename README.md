# Head-fixed Behavior
This repositor contains information about a multisensory head fixed setup for operant conditioning. Here, we want to share all relevant information about the setup used in the publication "..." by ...

# Overview
Opperant conditioning is essential for quantifying animal perception. We developed a head-fixed setup to  measure the behavioral output of animals while recording their brain activity with optophysiological and electrophysiological methods. This setup can perform a variety of protocols ranging from auditory, visual, tactile and even multi sensory. The protocols themselves are highly customizable so that they can be tailored precisely to the respective research objective.

# Requirements
{add existing component list here}

# Assembly of components
First of all, the base of the superstructure is required. The poles must therefore be arranged in such a way that they correspond to the purpose of your operating equipment later.
Do we really need this? We have everything in detail in the manual

# Installation

# Software
At the moment the setup  is running with Matlab.... Bpod.....additional packages???

To prepare your experiments start Matlab and enter "bpod" into the console. This will open the Bpod GUI. Now flush the spouts and press the start button after the spouts are flushed (this has to be calibrated occasionally). Now  choose your paradigm and adjust your subject and settings. Now adjust your spouts positions to a proper one and press the "give water" button. Now place your mouse into the setup and head fix it. The lick detection threshold may need to be adjusted. Now toggle the the button in the upper left from pause to run. If your experiment is done press the "stop" button.

# Future
Stay tuned for new paradigms and new features of the head-fixed setup.
Currently we are working on automization of data management and mouse detection.
